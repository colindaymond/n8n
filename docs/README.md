# n8n Documentation

This is the documentation of n8n; a free node-based "Open Source" (with Commons Clause)
Workflow Automation Tool.

It covers everything from setup, usage, to development. It is still work in progress and all contributions are welcome.


## What is n8n?

n8n (pronounced "nodemation") allows you to interconnect each and every app in the world with an API that enables you to share and manipulate that app's data without a single line of code. It is an easy to use, user-friendly and highly customizable service that includes an intuitive user interface for you to design unique workflows quickly. Hosted on your server and not based in the cloud, it keeps your sensible data secure in your own trusted database.
